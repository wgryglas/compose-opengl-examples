This project is based on link:https://github.com/chirontt/lwjgl3-helloworld-native[github lwjgl3-helloworld-native
] example of compiling lwjgl project with graalvm to native image.
The application is the HelloWorld link:https://www.lwjgl.org/guide[demo] for LWJGL 3.

The aim of this project is to prot original gradle build script (groovy) to its kotlin script version.

To compile native application you must install graalvm and specify its path as:

 - `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable

or by

 - `graalvmPath` property set in the "gradle.properties" file (the environment variable is checked first)

When above is done just run the `nativeImage` gradle task, for instance by running in the console:

```bash
./gradlew nativeImage
```
