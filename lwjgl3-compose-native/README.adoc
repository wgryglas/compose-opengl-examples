This project is based on link:https://github.com/chirontt/lwjgl3-helloworld-native[github lwjgl3-helloworld-native
] example of compiling lwjgl project with graalvm to native image.

In this project we compile the Google/Jetbrains Compose Desktop running in the LWJGL window.
The Compose Desktop still references multiple AWT elements under the hood. Thus it is not straightforward
to configure graalvm for compilation. In this project we have used the tracing agent ($GRAAL_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/output) to generate config files stored under /src/main/resources/META-INF.native-image:

 . jni-conifg.json
 . reflect-config.json

(rest config files are empty)


To compile native application you must install graalvm and specify its path as:

 - `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable

or by

 - `graalvmPath` property set in the "gradle.properties" file (the environment variable is checked first)

When above is done just run the `nativeImage` gradle task, for instance by running in the console:

```bash
./gradlew nativeImage
```

On windows you need to install and setup Visual Studio Toolchain
